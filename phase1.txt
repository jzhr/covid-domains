2. Twitter tweets dataset
 - webscrape using https://github.com/fajarmf10/GetOldTweets-python to generate tweet data in the following format:
 	- "username","date","retweets","favorites","text","geo","mentions","hashtags","id","permalink","emoji"
 - could use data to track emoji usage trends over time


3. Spotify dataset
